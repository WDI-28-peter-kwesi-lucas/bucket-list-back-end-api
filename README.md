# Bucket List Back End API

# How it works

### Once a user signs up and signs in, the user is able to create a bucket list item, along with a description that details what the user wants to do eventually in their lifetime (i.e. visit Hawaii, climb Mt. Kilimanjaro, etc.) In addition, the user can also update that entry and even check it off once they accomplish that item in their bucket list. A user can also delete their items whenever they decide to.
